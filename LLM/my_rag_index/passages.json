    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, and learn. AI includes various subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Modern AI applications range from recommendation systems (like Netflix or Amazon), voice assistants (Siri, Alexa), self-driving cars, to large language models such as GPT. Key aspects of AI: - Perception (computer vision, speech recognition) - Reasoning and decision making - Learning from data - Interaction through natural language",
